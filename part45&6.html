                <h3>What is Hardware</h3>
                <h4>
                    A computer is an electronic device that is programmed to store and
                    display information. The physical components that run a computer are
                    called computer hardware. As such, it is the backbone of the
                    computer, directly affecting its performance. Hardware primarily
                    targets the machine, Berger, A. S. (2005).

                <h4>
                    External peripherals are computer parts that operate outside the computer. The common external
                    peripherals in a computer are: monitors, printers, keyboards, scanners, and camera, Wilson, K. (2022).

                    <h4>Software refers to a set of instructions and algorithms that tells the
                        device what to do. It enables user interactivity and alongside
                        hardware is what keeps computers running today. It is used in our
                        daily activities. Software leans more to programming languages
                        and its concepts, Blum, E. K. (2011). <br>

                    <h4>
                        Software can be split into two different types, namely; application and system software.
                        System software is also commonly called an “operating system”. Operating systems are
                        the basic component of a computer and are what make computer hardware operate.
                        Application software refers to any software that runs to perform a specific task, that task
                        can be video editing, word processing, browsers, etc, James, K. L. (2013).

                was located in the top right corner. Memory was placed beside the
