                <h3>What are Number Systems</h3>
                <h4>
                    A number system is the style in which numbers are shown. It is an established method of writing, 
                    expressing, and representing numerical values. Number systems also display a collection of numbers 
                    consistently, Rossi, L., & Thuswaldner, J.M., (2022). It is also a well-defined method of writing, 
                    expressing, and displaying numerical values. The most common number systems in the field of 
                    computing are decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.The ability to understand these number 
                    systems is taught to students in computer-related college courses, Kempthorne, D. & Steele, A. (2014). 
                    Tackling microprocessors require knowledge about binary, decimal, and hexadecimal numeral 
                    systems. Latif, S., et al (2011).

                <h3>Uses of Number Systems</h3>

                <h4>• Numbering systems form the foundation for a variety of Computer Science courses. Knowing binary 
                      numbers is essential for grasping different Computer Science concepts, Polycarpou, I. (2014). <br><br>
                    • Binary number systems are used in a large range of applications, common ones are digital communication, 
                      networking, and encryption, Thomas, A, (2023) <br><br>
                    • Hexadecimals are commonly used in creating URLs and color codes due to their easy conversion to binary. 
                    Lande, D. (2014) <br><br>
                    • Decimals are used in our everyday lives
