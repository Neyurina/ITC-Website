                <h3>What is Computer Science</h3>
                <h4>Computer Science is the study that leans more on the theoretical
                aspect of computers compared to the other computing disciplines
                and majors Force, N. C. T. (2020) as it tackles theories related to
                hardware, software, and algorithms. Computer Science also deals with testing and 
                experimentation when creating or refining new algorithms and data structures Belford,
                G. G., & Tucker, A. (2024).

            <h3>History</h3>

                <h4>This disciplines origins can be dated back to the 1940s during the invention 
                    of digital computers. With the use of mathematics, the idea of storing and 
                    representing information through 1s and 0s was invented, which would be later
                    known as binary systems Belford, G. G., & Tucker, A. (2024). The creation of binary
                    systems is what helped in shaping computer science into the discipline that it is known
                    today
